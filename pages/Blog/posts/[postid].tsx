                            are just a few of the titles you may see in the solutions engineering world.</TextContent>
                        <TextContent>In partnership with sales teams, these individuals use extensive technical
                            knowledge to demonstrate the value of technology solutions to prospective

                        <TextContent>In this article, we will discuss a few of the key aspects within ClickUp which
                            enable us to be more productive than ever!</TextContent>

                            <TextContent>When someone says lip balm, you likely think of ChapStick. In a similar fashion,
                                when someone says CRM, you picture Salesforce.

                            </TextContent>
                            <TextContent>This is because Salesforce is fantastic at living up to its namesake and managing
                                customer relationships! A productivity tool like ClickUp offers collaboration benefits, not
                                in scope for your typical CRM.</TextContent>
                            <TextContent>One of the main focuses of a solutions engineering role is supporting a sales team,
                                so it‚Äôs critical that we‚Äôre always on the same page with our sales counterparts regarding
                                any customer engagements!</TextContent>
                            <TextContent>Our sales team tracks their contacts and activities within Salesforce, and so when
                                an opportunity reaches the stage where a solutions engineer is looped in, the integration
                                creates a related task within ClickUp and attaches a hyperlink to the task within Salesforce
                                under the ClickUp Task URL field.

                            </TextContent>

                            <TextContent>In a similar manner, the Salesforce Opportunity URL is also stored within ClickUp

                            <TextContent>None of this would be possible without ClickUp‚Äôs robust API, which enabled us to
                                create this integration to match our exact needs. Additionally, it‚Äôs given us the
                                flexibility to iteratively enhance it over time as we discover additional areas for process
                                improvement!

                            <TextContent>While driving a manual car may be a sense of pride for some, manually processing
                                work definitely is not!

                            </TextContent>
                            <TextContent>With ClickUp, we consistently leverage automations to minimize the manual work
                                needing to be completed by our team.</TextContent>
                            <TextContent>An example of this is when a sales opportunity is marked as ‚ÄúWon.‚Äù This triggers an
                                automation to apply a templated Doc, standardizing our pre-sales to post-sales
                                implementation hand-off process.</TextContent>
                            <TextContent>By having this automatically included in our workflow, we not only save
                                time‚Äîhistorically spent making these documents manually‚Äîbut also establish a more seamless
                                customer experience from start to finish!

                            </TextContent>
                            <TextContent>With such an intuitive user interface, our managers can effortlessly make updates
                                to any of their automations when required! Ôªøüï∫Ôªø

                            <TextItalic>Automations are used to automatically trigger results when an action takes place.
                                For example, using the ‚Äúwhen status changes‚Äù automation, we apply a template to a task to
                                ensure no valuable information is lost during client handoffs
                            </TextItalic>

                            <TextContent>With all the free time saved by automating administrative work, previously
                                completed manually, our managers have significantly more time to assist in deal strategy,
                                supporting us on live calls, and developing enablement material to help us grow as a team.

                            </TextContent>
                            <TextContent>This is just one example, but the sky is truly the limit in regards to what can be
                                automated using ClickUp!

                            <TextContent>It‚Äôs no secret that different individuals prefer to view their work in different
                                ways.

                            </TextContent>
                            <TextContent>With ClickUp, each Solutions Engineer can manage their active deals in the manner
                                they find most efficient! Using a combination of filters and grouping, we seamlessly drill
                                down into the details that matter the most and hide information that may not be the most
                                relevant such as deals that are on temporary hold.</TextContent>
                            <Image src={IMG_CARD_PROBLEM} layout={'responsive'}/>
                            <TextItalic>List view ensures that the solutions team can see the exact information that they
                                need
                            </TextItalic>
                            <TextItalic>I use a personalized view to help me review all of my solutions engineer engagements
                                with the sales professionals.

                                We are able to group by account executive and update each solutions engineer request in the
                                list as we go.

                                This also allows me to collapse the other account executives‚Äô opportunities so only one
                                person‚Äôs deals are shown on the screen. I can easily open the Task modal for each
                                opportunity and update any notes and next steps and then close it to go back to my view.

                                This makes my 1:1 meetings with the account executives much more efficient and allows us to
                                keep the focus on what matters most
